### Hi, I'm Thomas ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Security Software Engineer at Microsoft who specializes in writing and deploying secure code to secure systems.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an Azure Repos Pull Request cleanup bot called [BroomBot](https://github.com/thomasrayner/BroomBot), and a PowerShell module called [CATEncryptor](https://github.com/thomasrayner/CATEncryptor) for encrypting different types of data using an arbitrary certificate, as well as a VS Code extension called [RightLines](https://github.com/thomasrayner/rightlines) that adds marking and de-duping functionality to the VS Code editor.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently growing my skills related to software performance, and learning how to write children's books about technology topics.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that benefit the technology and software development community.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about secure software supply chain & CI/CD, professional development, writing code in .NET languages and TypeScript, working at Microsoft
