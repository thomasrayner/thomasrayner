### Hi, I'm Thomas ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Security Service Engineer at Microsoft who specializes in writing and deploying secure code to secure systems.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an Azure Repos Pull Request cleanup bot called [BroomBot](https://github.com/thomasrayner/BroomBot), and a PowerShell module called [CATEncryptor](https://github.com/thomasrayner/CATEncryptor) for encrypting different types of data using an arbitrary certificate.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning back-end web development, and how to write children's books about technology topics.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that benefit the technology and software development community.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about secure software supply chain, professional development, CI/CD, PowerShell, working at Microsoft, or anything else that's reasonable!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: By email at [thmsrynr@outlook.com](mailto:thmsrynr@outlook.com), on Twitter at [@MrThomasRayner](https://twitter.com/MrThomasRayner), or on [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/thomasrayner).
- âš¡ Fun fact: I got my CISSP, and I don't feel any different.
